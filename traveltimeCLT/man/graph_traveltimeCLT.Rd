\title{Created by Adrien Hernandez and Mohamad Elmasri
Travel time estimation modelling using Central Limit Theorem}
\usage{
graph_traveltimeCLT(data.train = NULL, L = NULL, data.timebins = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.train}{A dataframe that will be used to construct the graph.}

\item{L}{A parameter allowing to remove edges that have not enough observations in the train set.}

\item{data.timebins}{A vector of strings that represent the different timebins of the dataset.}
}
\description{
This function allows to create a graph from a train dataset.
A.0: We are splitting the link variable in two variable: linkId.from and LinkId.to
A.1: We compute the variance and mean velocity
A.2: We are creating a dataframe with all the necessary statistics called graph.stat.full
}
\details{
This function allows you to run the algorithm
}
\examples{
graph.traveltimeCLT(data.train = train, L = 2, data.timebins = c("MR", "ER", "Other"))
